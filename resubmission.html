							<h2 class="major">Learning outcomes</h2>
							<h3 class="major">How to organise an assignment</h2>
							 Regarding academic writing, I have been given valuable feedbacks throughout Resubmission Support or any other modules of the Universito of Essex Online.
							There are mainly four categories which are essential to organise an assignment effectively.  
							<br><br>
							<h4>Presentation and structure</h4>
							 It is important to think about the structure of paragraps at first.<br>
							The following step should be taken when writting an academic essay or a reflection(Shona, 2019).<br><br>
							1.Identify the main point and the purpose as a topic sentence<br>
							2.Give evidence to prove the view or thought<br>
							3.Explain the evidence and the detail of the main statement<br>
							4.Conclude the paragraph<br>
							5.Read through the whole paragraph
							<br><br>
							In addition, using transition sentences is effective to show relevance among different paragraph.
							<br><br>
							<h4>Grammer and spelling</h4>
							 This is a basic but important thing. There has been some gramatical errors or typo in my assignments throuhgout modules.<br>
							Using the extention to check grammatical mistakes in Word softwares such as following is very beneficial.<br><br>
							https://www.grammarly.com/office-addin
							<br><br>
							I learned that I could avoid gramatical or spelling errors by appling the checker to my assignment before submission.
							<br><br>
							<h4>Critical thinking</h4>
							 Critical thinking is one of the most essential element in academic writing.<br>
							Glaser (1941) states that critical tinking is a process to examine an issue more carefully and lead to conclude one's point of view with the evidence.<br><br>
							I have wrote some essays or reflections as an assignment through the course but given the feedback that the majority of my content contains too many subject materials.<br>
							Obviously, there was a shortage of my own point of view. Considering the importance of critical thinking, I could make a reflection which includes my own thought or emotion for Resubmission Support assignment.
							<br><br>
							<h4>Referencing and use of sources</h4>
							It is necessary to provide sources and evidence for statements or artefacts. <br>
							In Secure Software Development module, I could include little evidence for the module activities in my e-portfolio.<br>
							It seems this was the main reason I failed the module.<br>
							Given the feedback which informed me of the importance of sources and evidence, I have tried to contain lots of reference and clear evidence in my assingment for Resubmission Support module.
							<br><br>
							Thus, I have learned what kind of element is needed to succeed assignments in the academic field and the academic writing is more strict compared to general one.
							<br><br>

							<h3 class="major">The S-SDLC</h2>
							I learnend the SDLC as well as the S-SDLC. The following shows the general phase in the SDLC.
							<br><br>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<th>Phase</th>
									<th>Description</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Requirement</th>
									<th>Define the system requirement, solutions and architecture</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Design</th>
									<th>Design system functions</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Develop</th>
									<th>Implementaion and the unit testing</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Test</th>
									<th>Conduct the integration test and operational test</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Deploy</th>
									<th>Deploy the system to the production environment and operate it</th>
								</tr>
							</table>							

							On the other hand, the S-SDLC focuses on protecting from the security risk from an early stage of the development as below. 
							<br><br>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<th>Phase</th>
									<th>Description</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Requirement</th>
									<th>Define the security requirement</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Design</th>
									<th>Design review from a security perspective</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Develop</th>
									<th>Secure coding and detecting security risks by using static analysis tools</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Test</th>
									<th>Conduct the security test</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Deploy</th>
									<th>Conduct the penetration test in the production environment and report incidents. </th>
								</tr>
							</table>							
							As above, it is necessary to consider security risks at every stage of the development in the S-SDLC. 
							This is an effective way to enhance the security but it seems it requires the cost.
							I think it is important that the S-SDLC should be customised depending on the scale or the schedule of the project.
							<br><br>
							<h2 class="major">Artefacts</h2>
							I created Bank Account Management System as an assignment of Resubmission Support module. Operators can check the following information on this system.
							<br><br>
							- Customersâ€™ names, addresses and phone numbers<br>
							- The list of account numbers<br>
							- Account activities<br>
							<br><br>
							<h3 class="major">Architecture</h3>
							Below is the architecture of the system, which is implemented as a web applicaiton based on Django framework.<br>
							 The application is deployed to Oracle Cloud.
							 <br><br>

							<br><br><br>
							<h2 class="major">Reflection</h2>
							 This reflection explains my thought or belief that I have obtained throughout the module. It consists of four parts. 
							The first and the second part is what I thought while doing activities in Resubmission Support module.
							The Third part is my view with regard to the S-SDLC. The last part is about the plan to make use of what I have learned in the future.
							<br><br>
							<h3 class="major">Collaboration vs independent working</h3>
							 This section examines the pros and cons of collaborative activities and independent working respectively.<br>
							The main activity in Secure Software Development module is team working while I had to do independent activities in Resubmission Support module. It was necessary to design and develop a system with team members.
							The assignment should be submitted as a result of team working. It seems to be obvious that good teamwork can contribute to greater achievement compared to individual work.
							Rajalakshmi et al. (2021) argues that a team with the effective performance can lead to improvement in effectiveness and productivity of the organisational software development. 
							In fact, a complex architecture using a wider range of solutions could be implemented in the team activity in Secure Software Development module.
							What the team created was not just a simple web application but multifunctional applications deployed to micro services on s cloud, which got a distinct mark as a team.
							I believe it would not be possible without the collaborative work since all members had different background and skills.
							It is assumed that the collaboration of each background let to success.<br>
							 On the other hand, I have noticed the advantages of independent working in this module. The outcome which can be achieved tend to be more limited than group work as mentioned above.
							Even so, it is not necessary to care about other members' opinion or lifestyle in individual work. For example, there might be a difference in opinion with regards to a design policy for an assignment.
							It can consume a lot of workload to achieve an agreement. Even if it would be once agreed, there might be still obstacle.
							More members are involved in the activity, more inconsistency can be detected in the output. 
							Frederick (1974) argues that one or few architects should consider the system architecture to establish the design uniformity.
							Frederick also states adding new members to a project can lead to an increase in the cost due to the necessity of communication or teaching to newcomers.
							In Resubmission Support module, I could carry on learning at my own pace since all of assignments are an independent task.
							It seems to be easier for me that I could decided the direction of the assignments on my own.<br>
							In summary, it is said that there are both advantages and disadvantages in team working and individual working respectively as mentioned above.
							For me, An individual work is relatively easier to proceed. However, it was helpful experience for the future work that I have been involved in team activities since basically most of development projects require teamwork.
							<br><br>
							<h3 class="major">About the learning environment</h3>
							There are mainly two things that I would like to point out regarding the learning environment.
							One is about the development environment. Codio is available throughout the module as the development environment.
							Codio is a useful tool, and it enables learners to implement and run the application on a web browser.
							However, I wanted to learn how to use more common IDE effectively such as PyCharm or Visual Studio, which is widely used(Aryan, 2022). 
							If I learned those tools, it would help me to apply what I obtained to the future work.<br>
							 Another thing is difficulties to manage both a full-time job and learning in the University of Essex.
							I am working for an IT consulting company as an engineer and sometimes become busy depending on circumstances of the project.
							To be honest, it was a challenge for me to carry on this course with a time difference. 
							Despite the difficulties, most of my work in the modules could proceed as planned by using the online learning environment of the UoEO.
							I could access recorded lectures or e-books whenever I wanted to, which contributed to keep learning.<br>
							Overall, it can be said that the learning environment of the UoEO is beneficial for learners even if it has some issues. 
							<br><br>
							<h3 class="major">Secure development</h3>
							I learned the basic theory of the S-SDLC through Secure Software Development and Resubmisson Support module.
							What I am interested the most is security measures in offshore development, which I felt it was less featured in textbooks. 
							Outsourcing of Information System in organisations has been a trend recently(Myun et al. 2017).
							In my organisation, the project has outsourced the implementation and the unit test to an offshore development center abroad.
							It is thought that checking outsourced deliverables from a security perspective will be more important.
							I believe methods used in the secure coding or the security test, can be applicable to the future project. 
							<br><br>
							<h3 class="major">How to apply what I have learned to the future</h3>
							This section describes how I am going to use the knowledge that I obtained in the module.
							As mentioned, I am working as an engineer and have been involved in some software development projects.
							There has been a trend that project members work from home since the pandemic. Also, cloud services or outsourcing of the Information System has become more popular than before.
							Also, I work with global members in an offshore development centers.
							I feel that collaboration in a remote working environment and security measures, which is main areas in the module, is becoming more and more important.
							The below is a plan that I apply what I have learned to the workplace.
							<br><br>
							- To adopt the security review in a design and build phase to check if deliverables follow the security policy and secure coding. <br> 
							- To continue researching the way of collaboration with global peers and try using various management tools to enhance productivity. 
							<br><br>
							In conclusion, it was a great opportunity that I could obtain various things which is applicable to my own career through this course.
